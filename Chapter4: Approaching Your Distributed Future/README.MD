Chapter 4 changes gears by starting to focus on the imminent distributed future. Imminent because the future is already here, itâ€™s just not evenly distributed so the saying goes. And we agree with that. 

Different industries are at different stages with technology and methodology adoption. We look into the reasons why the future is distributed and revisited hybrid and multi cloud definitions while double-clicking on specific business and technology reasons why public or single cloud cannot be a target state for your operating model. We also spent time on different edge classifications such as near, far, device or enterprise, operations and provider edge to get a better handle on different view points in light of worthwhile use cases. We rounded the chapter out by looking at emerging trends and external factors such as compliance, mergers & acquisitions.
