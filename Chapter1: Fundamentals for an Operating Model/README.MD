Chapter 1 started out by looking at the challenges that  journeys to the cloud have thrown at organizations and why - with edge making its way in every industry - we can’t continue the same way we embarked on cloud journeys. We urged leadership to stay away from confusing marketing slogans like ‘cloud first' and explained why we have this stance.

We demystified terms like strategy, tactics, mission, vision, goals, capability and objectives. And not just that, we also connected them and showed the relationship between those terms.
We then revisited research on organizational cultures conducted by Dr Ron Westrum and how to create performance-oriented cultures. We did this because it is the reason why we chose the workshop practices we outline in this book. And to be precise, it’s to help create a culture with a high level of collaboration, information sharing and open communication. Because research has shown that those features are the enablers for high performing teams and organizations. Those are the same traits the open source movement displays by the way.

After that we took the Operating Model topic by its horn and faced it head on. We went through a rich set of examples from different consulting companies to look at their approaches and the way they define key components of an operating model: The Operating Model Dimensions. The examples hopefully helped you build confidence that whichever dimensions you choose you can rest assured that choosing the best-fit dimensions for your organization is automatically the most likely ones to be successful. In order to help you get a handle on the vast number of dimensions we grouped them into streams. This will help you to assemble and group your stakeholders. As an extra, we extended the Business Motivation Model meta model to show how an Operating Model can fit in with your strategy, and organizational capabilities that you need to execute your projects and programs.

We then expanded the operating model topic into the cloud and edge realm and defined edge computing.
Chapter 1 defined key terms that we needed for the book, but also stressed the fact that within a buzzword rich industry, organizations are well advised to define a shared vocabulary across teams. Key terms included Engineering and Operations, distinguished between platform and product engineering and SRE, and we hopefully transformed some buzzwords along the way into tangible relevant topics for you. Terms and topics you should ask every vendor to be clear about. This is not just a mechanism to unlock organizational capabilities but also a foundational means to practice an inclusive high performing culture because - with a common vocabulary - everyone is able to understand, discuss and contribute with regards to what the organization is going through once semantics are attached to the terminology used.
The chapter got rounded out with thoughts on how to construct metrics, teaming and how Conway's law affects your architecture.
